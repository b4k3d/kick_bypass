## Install Me

To install and use the **RateLimit Bypass** script from Greasy Fork, follow these steps:

1. **Install a User Script Manager**:
   - To run user scripts, you need a user script manager. Here are a few popular options:
     - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
     - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
     - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)

2. **Add the Script**:
   - Visit the [RateLimit Bypass script page on Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/494876-ratelimit-bypass).
   - Click the green "Install this script" button.
   - Your user script manager should prompt you to confirm the installation. Click "Install".

3. **Usage**:
   - Once installed, the script will automatically run on the websites it is designed for.
   - You don't need to do anything special; just browse the web as usual, and the script will handle bypassing rate limits in the background.
   - look for the custom emoi next to the troll face it'll open the panel
