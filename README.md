     - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
     - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
     - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)

2. **Add the Script**:
   - Visit the [RateLimit Bypass script page on Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/494876-ratelimit-bypass).
   - Click the green "Install this script" button.
   - Your user script manager should prompt you to confirm the installation. Click "Install".

3. **Usage**:
   - Once installed, the script will automatically run on the websites it is designed for, you may have to refresh it once or twice to get it to work.
   - You don't need to do anything special; just browse the kick as usual, and the script will handle bypassing rate limits in the background just spam away
   - you may notice an emoji to the right of the troll face, click it, it'll open a panel for your use.
