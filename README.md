     - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended for most browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge)
     - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (for Firefox)
     - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (supports Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers)
